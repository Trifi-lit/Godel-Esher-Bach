# Godel-Esher-Bach

This repository is inspired by Douglas R. Hofstadter's 'GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach' (https://www.amazon.com/G%C3%B6del-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden/dp/0465026567). I started by creating matlab scripts that calculate and plot recoursive functions mentioned in the book so I could get a better intuition about them, and the goal is to create a set of scripts that will make the reading of the book more interactive for anyone with basic programming skills. Matlab is chosen due to its simple structure, vast documentation and built in visualization options.
